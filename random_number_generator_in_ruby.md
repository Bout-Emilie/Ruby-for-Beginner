### Random number generator in ruby: ###

We can generate random number using the `rand` keyword.

We can pass an argument to `rand` to generate a number starting from zero up to (but not including) that number.

```console
rand 90
> 77
```

And for generating radom number within any range, we can do something like below

```console
rand 100..200
> 109
```
